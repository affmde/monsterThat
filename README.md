## Description

Save the princess.

Dress the skin of our adventurer boy and try to save Princess Elb after her kidnapping. In this RPG game you will have to fight against other adventurers and monsters in your journey to save the princess.

## Overview

After learn the basis of Phaser and create my first simple games, I decided to give a chance to something more complex using Tilemaps. I have always been a fan of Pokemon games even since old GameBoy. This way, I based this game on a mix of that old GameBoy pokemon games with the new Pokemon Go battle system. So, in the Adventurer you will walk in a 2D world where you must interact with different characters and objects. As an RPG you will collect items and improve your power and skills. The battle system is an interactive touching game where you must kill the opponent by tapping on him. But be fast because they also attack you as well. In the game you walk into different cities and to move forward you will need to defeat the Gym Leader that will give you a badge, what makes the city guards to go away of your way.
